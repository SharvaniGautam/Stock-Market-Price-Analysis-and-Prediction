# 🚀 Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning  
*Can we teach a computer to predict the stock market? Let’s find out.*

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly dive into using **Python + Machine Learning** to predict stock prices. Using real historical data from Yahoo Finance, we train a model that tries to guess future prices — like a crystal ball, but with code and math. 🔮

It's not just a project — it's a learning journey into:

- 📈 Time series data
- 🤖 Machine learning
- 💾 Model creation & prediction
- 🔧 Data wrangling and visualization

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Main programming language |
| **Pandas, NumPy** | Data handling |
| **Matplotlib** | Visualization |
| **yfinance** | Pulling live stock data |
| **Scikit-learn / Keras** | ML model training & evaluation |
| **Model Used** | Long Short Term Memory Netwrok (LSTM) |




🧠 What’s LSTM? (**Hint** It comes from *RNN Family*)


LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of neural network specially designed for time series data — like stock prices, weather trends, or anything that changes over time.

It remembers patterns from the past to make better guesses about the future.

Each LSTM cell decides what to "remember", what to "forget", and what to "output". This helps it track patterns over long sequences.

💡 Why Use LSTM for Stocks?
Traditional models look at data like a spreadsheet.
LSTM looks at data like a story unfolding over time.

✅ Good at handling trends, momentum, and historical behavior and best for sequential data.

🔄 LSTM in This Project
If you add LSTM, your workflow will look like this:

📥 Pull stock data with yfinance

🧹 Normalize & reshape the data

🧠 Feed it into an LSTM model (from Keras)

📈 Get predictions for future prices

🎨 Visualize predictions vs. real data

## 🚦 What You’ll Learn

- How to get stock data using `yfinance`
- How to clean and visualize time series data
- How to build a prediction model (linear regression or deep learning)
- How to evaluate model accuracy (spoiler: stock market = tricky 😅)

## 📌 Quick Tips

- The default stock is set to `'APPL'` — you’ll want to correct that to `'AAPL'` (Apple Inc.).
- The notebook pulls live data from Yahoo Finance, so make sure you're connected to the internet.
- This project is a **great foundation** for building something cooler — like a web app or a dashboard.



## 🌱 What’s Next?

- 💾 Save the trained model (`.keras` or `.h5`)
- 🌐 Build a simple **Streamlit app** to interact with predictions
- 📊 Add technical indicators for smarter predictions
- ⏳ Try LSTM or time series forecasting for better performance



## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project is your gateway into the real world of finance + machine learning. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s **learning by building**. And hey, if you teach a model to predict the market... maybe it’ll teach you something too. 😉
