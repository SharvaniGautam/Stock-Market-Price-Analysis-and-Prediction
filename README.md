# 🚀 Stock Market Prediction with Machine Learning  
*Can we teach a computer to predict the stock market? Let’s find out.*

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly dive into using **Python + Machine Learning** to predict stock prices. Using real historical data from Yahoo Finance, we train a model that tries to guess future prices — like a crystal ball, but with code and math. 🔮

It's not just a project — it's a learning journey into:

- 📈 Time series data
- 🤖 Machine learning
- 💾 Model creation & prediction
- 🔧 Data wrangling and visualization

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Main programming language |
| **Pandas, NumPy** | Data handling |
| **Matplotlib** | Visualization |
| **yfinance** | Pulling live stock data |
| **Scikit-learn / Keras** | ML model training & evaluation |

---

## 🚦 What You’ll Learn

- How to get stock data using `yfinance`
- How to clean and visualize time series data
- How to build a prediction model (linear regression or deep learning)
- How to evaluate model accuracy (spoiler: stock market = tricky 😅)

---

## 🧪 How to Use This Notebook

1. **Clone or download the repo**
2. Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance scikit-learn tensorflow
```

3. Fire up the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Stock_Market_Prediction_Model_Creation.ipynb
```

4. Run it cell-by-cell. Watch the magic happen.



## 📌 Quick Tips

- The default stock is set to `'APPL'` — you’ll want to correct that to `'AAPL'` (Apple Inc.).
- The notebook pulls live data from Yahoo Finance, so make sure you're connected to the internet.
- This project is a **great foundation** for building something cooler — like a web app or a dashboard.



## 🌱 What’s Next?

- 💾 Save the trained model (`.keras` or `.h5`)
- 🌐 Build a simple **Streamlit app** to interact with predictions
- 📊 Add technical indicators for smarter predictions
- ⏳ Try LSTM or time series forecasting for better performance



## 🧠 Final Thoughts

This project is your gateway into the real world of finance + machine learning. The goal isn’t perfection — it’s **learning by building**. And hey, if you teach a model to predict the market... maybe it’ll teach you something too. 😉
